Tumblr Themes TextMate Bundle 1.1
---------------------------------

### What is this? ###

This is is a tmbundle for the Mac text editor [TextMate](http://macromates.com/). It contains snippets for every Block an Variable from the the Tumblr custom themes docs as of March 2010. There are a lot of snippets in this bundle, about a megabyte's worth (which is pretty fucking big for a TextMate bundle). They have been organized in a manner that is similar to the [theme docs](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes), but some adjustments have been made to make the snippets easy accessible in the contextual menu.
