Tumblr Themes TextMate Bundle 2.0 beta
--------------------------------------

### What is this? ###

This is is a tmbundle for the Mac text editor [TextMate](http://macromates.com/). It contains snippets for every Block an Variable from the the Tumblr custom themes docs as of April 2011. There are a lot of snippets in this bundle, about a megabyte's worth (which is pretty fucking big for a TextMate bundle). They have been organized in a manner that is similar to the [theme docs](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes), but some adjustments have been made to make the snippets easy accessible in the contextual menu.

This version is still a work in progress and I plan on finishing it up very soon...
